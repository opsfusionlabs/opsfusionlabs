As Pods come-and-go (scaling, failures, rollouts etc.), the Service dynamically updates its list of healthy matching Pods. It does this through a combination of label selection and a construct called an Endpoints object.

Every time you create a Service, Kubernetes automatically creates an associated Endpoints object. The Endpoints object is used to store a dynamic list of healthy Pods matching the Serviceâ€™s label selector.

> Note: Recent versions of Kubernetes are replacing Endpoints objects with more efficient Endpoint slices. The functionality is identical, but Endpoint slices are higher performance and more efficient.
