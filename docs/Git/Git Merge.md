Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The `git merge` command lets you take the independent lines of development created by `git branch` and integrate them into a single branch.

Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch. The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. Again, this means that `git merge` is often used in conjunction with `git checkout`for selecting the current branch and `git branch -d` for deleting the obsolete target branch.
